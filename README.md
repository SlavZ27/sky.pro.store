## About sky.pro.store

This learning project in Java Spring focuses on building a backend application for a bulletin board. The application accepts http requests from the frontend, processes them, and provides a response. The main functions of the application include managing ads, comments, and user registration. Users can edit and delete their own objects, while special users with administrative privileges can moderate the bulletin board.

To work, the application requires Postgresql with an empty database, and the connection parameters need to be configured using environment variables:
- spring.datasource.url
- spring.datasource.username
- spring.datasource.password

Technologies used:
- Java 11
- Spring security
- Spring Boot/Web
- Mapstruct
- PostgreSQL
- Liquibase
- Swagger
- Faker and h2 for testing purposes.
- JUnit, Mockito

This project provides a great opportunity to learn and practice Java Spring development skills, including working with databases, security, and testing frameworks.
